# ROVI_lego_drone-
Build a surveillance system for a lego drone which can follow a moving object fitted with a physical marker from the MarkerLocator project. This should be realised using the on-board camera. The camera will stream to a computer, where the image processing will be done. The computer will then output the controls for the drone.
